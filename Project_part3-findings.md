# Machine Learning Analysis 

---

I have implemented the machine learning tasks using the same "210_project.ipynb" notebook files used in the EDA phase. Machine learning goals were done in two sections:

    1- Regression: Predict gene expression levels (ALK, KRAS, EGFR) using tobacco and alcohol risk scores.
    2- Classification:
      - Binary: Predict whether gene expression level is "high" or "low".
      - Multiclass: Predict patient's tobacco risk group from gene expression profiles.
